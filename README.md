# ESILV - Python For Data Analysis - Project 2023
<br>

### Introduction
This repository contains all files related to the final project of the course Python For Data Analysis. The goal of this final project is to analyze a dataset, build a predictive model, and implement an API. Among the 3 datasets that were assigned to us, "Online Shopper Purchasing Intention dataset" is the one that we have chosen to study. 
 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to predict the purchasing intention of a visitor for a particular online store. 

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. The 'Revenue' attribute can be used as the class label. Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.


### Predictive modeling


### API Implementation
1. Download and extract the zip file related to this repository.
1. Open the file titled "API" on Visual Studio Code or another IDE of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and execute the "run.py" file by entering the following command :
```python
python run.py
```
3. The output will display the link on which the server is running (for me it was http://127.0.0.1:5000, it might be different for you)
4. Copy-paste the link on your browser.
5. Fill in the form with your input data and submit it by clicking on the "Predict" button.
6. After submitting the form, scroll down as the result of the prediction should be displayed (ie if either the customer will or not purchase).
